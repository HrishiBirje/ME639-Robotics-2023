## Task 0
Include a neat handwritten derivation of the 6 key equations derived in class with regard to the kinematics, dynamics, and statics of the elbow manipulator. 
Include neat free-body diagrams, assumptions,  and any explanations to go with the derivations.

## Task 1
Write a Python simulation with visualization that implements a trajectory following a controller that makes the robot follow an arbitrary end-tip trajectory. 

## Task 1a. 
Analyze how different the results are when dynamics are included versus not included (try both low-speed and high-speed trajectories).

## Task 2 
Assume a wall location and orientation, develop and implement using a Python simulation and visualization the task of the robot reaching the wall and 
then applying a prespecified force in the normal direction of the wall.

## Task 3 
Develop and implement a control scheme that makes the robot end-tip act like a virtual spring-centered at the mean position of xo and yo. 
Demonstrate the performance of this method by initializing from a few different points away from xo and yo.

## Task 4 
If both joint angles can only sweep between 35 degrees and 145 degrees, determine and plot the workspace for the robot.
